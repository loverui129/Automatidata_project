# Automatidata Project

### Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year.

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and a multiple linear regression model.

The goal is to build a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the model.

### Project deliverables
1. Complete exploratory data analysis.

2. Perform any data cleaning and data analysis steps to understand unusual variables (e.g., outliers).

3. Use descriptive statistics to learn more about the data. 

4. Build a regression model in Python
